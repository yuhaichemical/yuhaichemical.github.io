<h1>1. UV Varnishing (Spot UV & Rollercoat)</h1><a name="1"></a><a href="#top">Top</a>
<p>

<strong>How do we do it?</strong> Spot UV Varnishing is a Screen Printing Process, from the artwork a Silk Screen is made and the varnish applied to the desired areas using the screen.  
</p>
<p>

Ask us about how to create the artwork for Spot UV, we can provide advice that will ensure your print job is produced smoothly with no problems. 
</p>

<h1>3.  All Over UV Varnish (Rollercoat)</h1><a name="3"></a><a href="#top">Top</a>

<p>
<strong>Definition:</strong> UV Rollercoat Varnish is a high gloss varnish applied to the whole of the printed page or spread(not to specific areas).  
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is it used for?</strong> It is used to enhance the printed poduct with a high gloss effect. It's is most commonly used on Brochure & Magazine Covers.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>More about...</strong> Rollercoat UV Varnishing gives a similar effect to Gloss Lamination, is cheaper, but can be liable to a small amount of cracking on folds. It is generally not used for smaller runs as the saving from Gloss lamination would be minimal for a short print run. 
</p>

<h1>4. Ultra-violet coating of paper</h1> <a name="4"></a><a href="#top">Top</a>
<p>
Ultra-violet cured coatings can be applied over ink printed on paper and dried by exposure to UV radiation. UV coatings can be formulated up to 100% solids so that they have no volatile component that contributes to pollution. This high solids level also allows for the coating to be applied in very thin films. UV coatings can be formulated to a wide variety of gloss ranges. UV coating can be most conventional industrial coating applications as well as by silkscreen.
</p>
<p>
Due to the normally high solids content of UV coating/varnish the surface of the cured film can be extremely reflective and glossy. 80 text and heavier weights of paper can be UV coated, however, cover weights are preferred. UV can be used on smooth, uncoated papers.
</p>
<p>
UV can be applied on spot locations of the paper or by flooding the page. This coating application can deepen the color of the printed area. Drying is virtually instantaneous when exposed to the correct level of UV light so projects can move quickly into the bindery. Like the other coatings, consult the bindery for projects requiring gluing. Using a strippable coating blanket can eliminate glue issues. New, Innovative coating blanket solutions have been developed recently that allow for this to be done.
</p>
<p>
A printed page with UV coating applied can be very shiny or flattened to a matte finish. A good example of UV coated paper is photo paper sold for home printing projects. UV coatings that are not fully cured can have a slightly sticky feeling.

</p>
<p>
※ Spot UV is ideal for use on used on Brochures, Annual Reports – but note that Spot UV is charged per thousand sheets, but there is a significant minimum charge – so printing up to 1000 copies doesn’t give any economies of scale.
